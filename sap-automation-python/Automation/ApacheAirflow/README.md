# Apache Airflow Orchestration

This step demonstrates the orchestration and automation of ETL processes using Apache Airflow, focusing on creating the necessary DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) to automate workflows. Airflow provides a more scalable and efficient way to orchestrate tasks and automate workflows compared to simpler alternatives like batch scripts and Windows Task Scheduler.

## Key Steps

### 1. **Extraction**
Data is pulled from SAP using a custom Python script (`Sap_integration.py`). Airflow automates the scheduling of this extraction through the DAG, ensuring timely and consistent data retrieval.

### 2. **Transformation**
Python facilitates the cleaning and transformation of raw data. The DAG orchestrates this step, managing dependencies between tasks and ensuring that any potential issues are handled automatically, allowing for a smooth and efficient transformation process.

### 3. **Loading and Reporting**
The cleaned data is then loaded into Power BI, where semantic models and dashboards are refreshed. Airflow triggers this update through the DAG, ensuring that the latest data is always available for reporting and analysis.

## Conclusion
The creation of a well-structured DAG is central to streamlining the entire workflow, from data extraction to reporting, minimizing manual intervention and reducing the risk of errors. This makes it an ideal solution for automating complex data processes and ensuring reliable, up-to-date reporting.
